\section{Cross talk}
\label{sec:CrossTalk}

The following variable has been defined:
\begin{displaymath}
\alpha(i,\mathrm{seed}) = < \mathrm{SNR}_i/\mathrm{SNR}_\mathrm{seed} >,
\end{displaymath}
where $\mathrm{SNR}_i$ is the SNR associated to the $i^{th}$ readout channel, $\mathrm{SNR}_\mathrm{seed}$ is the SNR associated to the seed readout channel, and the average is performed over all events having the same seed.
According to this definition, $\alpha(i,\mathrm{seed})$ is 1 for $i = \mathrm{seed}$ and varies between 0 and 1 for the rest of the readout channels. 
For a given seed readout strip, a SNR significantly different from zero is expected on the neighbouring strips that contribute to the same cluster and, possibly, on their neighbours too. A non-negligible value of $\alpha(i,\mathrm{seed})$ in regions far from the seed readout strip would be an indication of a cross talk induces by the pitch adapter.
The two dimensional map of $\alpha(i,\mathrm{seed})$ is shown in Figs. \ref{fig:CrossTalkMPARegion} and \ref{fig:CrossTalkMCentralRegion} for the mini sensors hit by the beam in the pitch adapter region and, respectively, in the central region, and in Fig. \ref{fig:CrossTalkF} for the half size sensor.
